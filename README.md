# ðŸ“¨ Handle Notification Tap Events in Flutter

This repository contains sample code for handling **notification tap events** in Flutter â€” for example, navigating to a specific screen when a user taps a push notification.

The implementation follows **Flutterâ€™s declarative UI model** and avoids using **GlobalKeys** or imperative access to `BuildContext`. It promotes clean, maintainable, and testable code, aligned with best practices.
